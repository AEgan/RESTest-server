RESTest - server
================

This is an implementation of a RESTful API server in node. The view in this repo, which can be found in views/index.ejs, is a demonstration of using the api as you would a web app.

On another repo I have on GitHub, you will find an iOS application that accesses this server (technically just localhost:12345) and makes the same calls as the web application does. 

This is not very full featured, and currently does not have persistent storage. Currently the "database" is an array that is created when the server starts.

I am doing this as a way to learn about how to make an API in node and how to make HTTP requests in Objective-C for iOS applications.
